= Documentation for WebAuthn Verify Account Feature

The webauthn_verify_account feature implements setting up an WebAuthn authenticator
during the account verification process, and making such setup
a requirement for account verification.  By default, it disables
asking for a password during account creation and verification,
allowing for completely passwordless designs, where the only
authentication option is WebAuthn. It depends on the verify_account
and webauthn features.
