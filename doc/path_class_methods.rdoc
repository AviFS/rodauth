= Documentation for Path Class Methods Feature

The path class methods feature allows for calling the *_path and *_url
methods directly on the class, as opposed to an instance of the class.

In order for the *_url methods to be used, you must use the base_url
configuration so that determining the base URL doesn't depend on the
submitted request, as the request will not be set when using the
class method. Failure to do this will probably result in a NoMethodError
being raised.
