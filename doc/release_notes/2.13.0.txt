= New Features

* A set_error_reason configuration method has been added.  This method
  is called whenever a error occurs in Rodauth, with a symbol
  describing the error.  The default implementation of this method does
  nothing, it has been added to make it easier for Rodauth users to
  implement custom handling for specific error types.  See the Rodauth
  documentation for this method to see the list of symbols this method
  can be called with.

= Other Improvements

* When using active_sessions and jwt_refresh together, and allowing for
  expired JWTs when refreshing, you can now call
  rodauth.check_active_session before r.rodauth.  Previously, this
  did not work, and you had to call rodauth.check_active_session
  after r.rodauth.

* The default templates now also support Bootstrap 5.
