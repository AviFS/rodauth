= New Features

* rodauth.otp_available? has been added for checking whether the
  account is allowed to authenticate with OTP.  It returns true
  when the account has setup OTP and OTP use is not locked out.

* rodauth.recovery_codes_available? has been added for checking
  whether the account is allowed to authenticate using a recovery
  code.  It returns true when there are any available recovery
  codes for the account to use.

= Other Improvements

* The otp feature no longer includes the <?xml> tag for svg images,
  since that results in invalid HTML.
