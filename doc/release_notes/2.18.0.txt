= New Features

* When using the json and multifactor auth features, the JSON API can
  now access the multifactor-manage route to get lists of endpoints
  for setting up and disabling supported multifactor authentication
  methods.  The JSON API can now also access the multifactor-auth
  route to get a list of endpoints for multifactor authentication for
  the currently logged in account.

= Other Improvements

* In the otp feature, the viewbox: true rqrcode option is now used
  when creating the QR code.  This results in a QR code that is
  displayed better and is easier to style.  This option only has
  an effect when using rqrcode 2+.

* When using the :auth_class option when loading the rodauth plugin,
  the configuration name is set in the provided auth class, unless the
  auth class already has a configuration name set.

* The example migration now recommends using a partial index on the
  email column in cases where the database supports partial indexes.
  Previously, it only recommended it on PostgreSQL.

* The argon2 feature now works with argon2 2.1.0.  Older versions of
  Rodauth work with both earlier and later versions of argon2, but
  not 2.1.0.
