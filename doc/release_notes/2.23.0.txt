= Improvements

* The otp feature now uses the :use_path option when rendering QR
  codes, resulting in significantly smaller svg images.

* Removing all multifactor authentication methods now removes the fact
  that the session was authenticated via SMS, if the user used SMS as
  an authentication method for the current session.

* The invalid domain check in the internal_request feature now works
  correctly when using the rack master branch.

* The :httponly cookie option is no longer set automatically in the
  remember feature if the :http_only cookie option was provided by the
  user (rack recognizes both options).
