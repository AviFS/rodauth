= New Features

* A rodauth.current_route method has been added for returning the route
  name symbol (if rodauth is currently handling the route).  This makes it
  simpler to write code that extends Rodauth and works with
  applications that use override the default route names.

* A remove_all_active_sessions_except_for method has been added to the
  active_sessions feature, which removes all active sessions for the
  current account, except for the session id given.

* A remove_all_active_sessions_except_current method has been added to
  the active_sessions feature, which removes all active sessions for
  the current account, except for the current session.

= Improvements

* Rodauth now supports overriding webauthn_rp_id in the webauthn
  feature.

* When using the login feature, Rodauth now defaults
  require_login_redirect to use the path to the login route, instead
  of /login.

* When setting up multifactor authentication, Rodauth now handles the
  case where account has been deleted, instead of raising an exception.

* When a database connection is not available during startup, Rodauth
  now handles that case instead of raising an exception.  Note that in
  this case, Rodauth cannot automatically setup a conversion of token
  ids to integer, since it cannot determine whether the underlying
  database column uses an integer type.

* When using WebAuthn 3+, Rodauth no longer defines singleton methods
  to work around limitations in WebAuthn.  Instead, it uses public
  APIs that were added in WebAuthn 3.
