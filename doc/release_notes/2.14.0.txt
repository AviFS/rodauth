= New Features

* A remembered_session_id method has been added for getting the
  account id from a valid remember token, without modifying the
  session to log the account in.

= Other Improvements

* The jwt_refresh feature's support for allowing refresh with
  an expired access token now works even if the Rodauth
  configuration uses an incorrect prefix.

* The internal account_in_unverified_grace_period? method now
  returns false if an account has not been loaded and the
  session has not been logged in. Previously, calling this
  method in such cases would result in an exception being
  raised.
