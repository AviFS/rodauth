= Improvements

* Token ids submitting in requests are now converted to integers if
  the configuration uses an integer primary key for the accounts
  table.  If the configuration uses a non-integer primary key for
  the accounts table, the convert_token_id configuration method can
  be used, which should return the token id converted to the
  appropriate type, or nil if the token id is not valid for the type.

  This revised handling avoids raising a database error when an
  invalid token is submitted.

* The button template can now be overridden in the same way that
  other Rodauth templates can be overridden.

* When using the Bootstrap CSS framework, the text field in the
  Webauthn setup and auth forms is automatically hidden.  The text
  field already had a rodauth-hidden class to make it easy to hide
  when using other CSS frameworks.

* The email_from and email_to methods are now public instead of
  private.

* A nicer error is raised if the Sequel Database object is missing.

* A regression in the TOTP QR output that resulted in the QR codes
  being solid black squares has been fixed (this was fixed in
  Rodauth 2.26.1).

= Backwards Compatibility

* The webauth_credentials_for_get method in the webauthn feature has
  been renamed to webauthn_credentials_for_get for consistency with
  other methods.  The webauth_credentials_for_get method will still
  work until Rodauth 3, but will issue deprecation warnings.
