= New Features

* Rodauth.lib has been added for using Rodauth purely as a library,
  useful in non-web applications:

    require 'rodauth'
    rodauth = Rodauth.lib do
      enable :create_account, :change_password
    end
    rodauth.create_account(login: 'foo@example.com', password: '...')
    rodauth.change_password(account_id: 24601, password: '...')

  This is built on top of the internal_request feature, and works by
  creating a Roda application with the rodauth plugin, and returning
  the related Rodauth::Auth class.

= Other Improvements

* The internal_request feature now works correctly for configurations
  where only_json? is set to true.
