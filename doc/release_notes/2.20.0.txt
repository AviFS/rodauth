= Improvements

* When using the active_sessions and remember features together,
  doing a global logout will automatically remove the remember key for
  the account, so the account will no longer be able to automatically
  create new sessions using the remember key.

* The default value of webauthn_rp_id now removes the port from the
  origin if it exists, since the WebAuthn spec does not allow ports
  in the relying party identifier.
