* When using the verify_account_grace_period feature, if the grace
  period has expired for currently logged in session, require_login
  will clear the session and redirect to the login page.  This is
  implemented by having the unverified_account_session_key store the
  time of expiration, as an integer.

* The previously private require_account method is now public. The
  method is used internally by Rodauth to check that not only is the
  current session logged in, but also that the account related to the
  currently logged in session still exists in the database.  The only
  reason you would want to call require_account instead of
  require_authentication is if you want to handle cases where there
  can be logged in sessions for accounts that have been deleted.

* Rodauth now avoids an unnecessary bcrypt hash calculation when
  updating accounts when using the account_password_hash_column
  configuration method.

* When WebAuthn token last use times are displayed, Rodauth now uses a
  fixed format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, instead of relying on
  Time#to_s.  If this presents an problem for your application, please
  open an issue and we can add a configuration method to control
  the behavior.

* A typo in the default value of global_logout_label in the
  active_sessions feature has been fixed.
