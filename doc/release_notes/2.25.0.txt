= New Features

* You can now disable routing to specific routes by calling the
  related *_route configuration method with nil or false.  The main
  reason you would want to do this is if you want to load a feature,
  but only want to use it for internal requests (using the
  internal_request feature), and not have the feature's routes exposed
  to users.
