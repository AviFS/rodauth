= New Features

* A throw_rodauth_error method has been added to make it easier
  for external extensions to throw the expected error value without
  setting a field error.

= Improvements

* If an account is not currently logged in, but Rodauth knows the
  related account id, remove_all_active_sessions and related
  methods in the active_sessions plugin will now remove sessions
  for the related account.

* When using the internal_request feature and subclasses,
  internal_request_configuration blocks in superclasses are now
  respected when creating the internal request class for a
  subclass.  When creating the internal request in the subclass,
  this behaves as if all internal_request_configuration blocks
  were specified directly in the subclass.

* An ignored block warning on Ruby 3.4 is now avoided by having
  Rodauth.load_dependencies accept a block.
