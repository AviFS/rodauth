= New Features

* Rodauth now ignores parameters containing ASCII NUL bytes ("\0") by
  default.  You can customize this behavior using the
  null_byte_parameter_value configuration method.

* A reset_password_notify feature has been added for emailing users
  after successful password resets.

* External features can now use the email method inside their
  feature definitions to DRY up the creation of email configuration
  methods. The email method will setup the following configuration
  methods for the feature:

  * ${name}_email_subject
  * ${name}_email_body
  * create_${name}_email
  * send_${name}_email

= Other Improvements

* The active_sessions feature now correctly handles logouts for
  sessions that were created before the active_sessions feature was
  added to the Rodauth configuration.

* The change_password_notify feature now works correctly when using
  template precompilation.

* The update_sms method now updates the in-memory sms hash instead of
  the in-memory account hash.  This only has an effect if you are
  using the sms_codes feature and customizing Rodauth to access one
  of these hashes after a call to update_sms.

= Backwards Compatibility

* If your application requires the ability to submit values containing
  ASCII NUL bytes ("\0") as Rodauth parameters, you should use the
  new null_byte_parameter_value configuration method to pass the
  value through unchanged:

    null_byte_parameter_value do |_, v|
      v
    end
