= New Features

* When using the remember feature, by default, the remember deadline
  is extended while logged in, if it hasn't been extended in the last
  hour

* An account! method has been added, which will return the hash for
  the account if already retrieved, or attempt to retrieve the
  account hash using the currently logged in session if not.
  Because of the ambiguity in the provenance of the returned account
  hash, callers should be careful when using this method.

* A remove_active_session method has been added.  You can call this
  method with a specific session id, and it will remove the related
  active session.

* A render: false plugin option is now support, which will disable
  the automatic loading of the render plugin.  This should only be
  used if you are completely replacing Rodauth's view rendering with
  your own.

= Other Improvements

* When logging in when using the active_sessions feature, if there is
  a current active session, it is removed before a new active session
  is created. This prevents some stale active sessions from remaining
  in the database (which would eventually be cleaned up later).
