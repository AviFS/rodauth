= New Features

* A webauthn_key_insert_hash configuration method has been added when
  using the webauthn feature, making it easier to add new columns to
  the webauthn key data, such as a custom name for the authenticator.

= Other Improvements

* When using the verify_account_grace_period feature, logged_in? now
  returns false for sessions where the grace period has expired.

* When using the internal_request and reset_password features,
  submitting an internal request for an invalid login no longer tries
  to render a reset password request form.

* The password_hash method is now public.
