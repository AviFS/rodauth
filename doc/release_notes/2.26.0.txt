= New Features

* An argon2_secret configuration method has been added to the argon2
  feature, supporting argon2's built-in password peppering.

= Other Improvements

* Links are no longer automatically displayed for routes that are
  disabled by calling the *_route method with nil.

* The QR code used by the otp feature now uses a white background
  instead of a transparent background, fixing issues when the
  underlying background is dark.

* Input parameter bytesize is now limited to 1024 bytes by default.
  Parameters larger than that will be ignored, as if they weren't
  submitted.

* The Rodauth::Auth class for internal request classes now uses the
  same configuration name as the class it is based on.

* The session_key_prefix configuration method no longer also prefixes
  the keys used in the flash hash.

* The *_path and *_url methods now return nil when the related *_route
  method returns nil, indicating the route is disabled.

* A more explicit error message is raised when using a feature that
  requires the hmac_secret being set and not setting hmac_secret.

= Backwards Compatibility

* If you are using session_key_prefix and flash messages, you will
  probably need to adjust your code to remove the prefix from the
  expected flash keys, or manually prefix the flash keys by using
  the flash_error_key and flash_notice_key configuration methods.

* The limiting of input parameter bytesizes by default could potentially
  break applications that use Rodauth's parameter parsing method to
  handle parameters that Rodauth itself doesn't handle.  You can use
  the max_param_bytesize configuration method to set a larger bytesize,
  or use a value of nil with the method for the previous behavior of
  no limit.  Additionally, to customize the behavior if a parameter
  is over the allowed bytesize, you can use the
  over_max_bytesize_param_value configuration method.
