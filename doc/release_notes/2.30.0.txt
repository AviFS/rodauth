= New Features

* A webauthn_autofill feature has been added to allow autofilling
  webauthn credentials during login (also known as conditional
  mediation).  This allows for easier login using passkeys.
  This requires a supported browser and operating system on the
  client side to work.

= Other Improvements

* The load_memory method in the remember feature no longer raises
  a NoMethodError if the there is a remember cookie, the session is
  already logged in, and the account no longer exists.  The
  load_memory method now removes the remember cookie and clears the
  session in that case.
